# The 1% Club

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**The 1% Club** is a British game show that has aired on ITV since 9 April 2022, and is hosted by Lee Mack. The show is styled as an IQ test and the questions are not based on general knowledge, like many shows, but on "logic and common sense". The top prize achievable is £100,000.

## Gameplay

All questions used during the game are taken from a set that have been put to members of the general public prior to the show. The questions are classified by the percentage of participants who answered correctly; those with lower percentages are considered to be more difficult.

One hundred contestants are each given a £1,000 stake at the beginning of the game. The host asks 15 questions of increasing difficulty (90% to 1%), each of which has a 30-second time limit, and the contestants secretly lock in their answers on their mobile phones or tablets. If a contestant misses a question, they are eliminated with their stake added to the final prize pot.

Upon reaching the fifth question (50%), each remaining contestant is given the option to pass on any one question except the last (1%). In order to pass, a contestant must put their £1,000 into the prize pot. Upon reaching the ninth question (30%), any contestants who have not yet used their pass may either keep their £1,000 and immediately leave the game, or continue playing; those who have used their pass must continue.

All contestants who answer the 14th question (5%) correctly or pass it, or who advance the furthest in the game if all 100 are eliminated, become finalists. They may each choose to take an equal share of £10,000 and leave the game, or attempt the 1% question. Any contestants who attempt the question and answer it correctly receive equal shares of the prize pot; those who miss it receive nothing. However, any contestants who reach the 1% question without using their pass or giving an incorrect answer are guaranteed a minimum of £1,000 regardless of the final outcome.
